            <h4 class="Subheader">Growing Up</h4>

            <p class="Childhood">I grew up in MD and FL, mostly FL as thats where I did a majority of my highschool. I am
                hispanic, Dominican on my mothers side and Columbian on my fathers. I spent a lot of time with my older
                brother growing up as we are only two years apart, we loved playing xbox and watching comedy central on TV
                after school. Growing up in the 21st century, technology has been around me my entire life. I built my
                own PC when I had turned 13 but I was taking apart electronics and putting them back together since I was 8
                years old.</p>

            <h4 class="Subheader">Passions &amp; Hobbies</h4>
            <p class="PandH">I loved boxing when I was younger and want to get back into it while im still young enough.
                This software engineering course is going to enable me to do what I've wanted to try since I first used a
                computer, make my own operating system.</p>
